>This tutorial will teach us how to read, write, and work with the meta-data information stored in different kinds of files. To do this, we’ll be utilizing a program called “ExifTool.” Exchangeable Image File Format, or EXIF for short, is a standard for adding metadata to specific kinds of files.


# Introduction #

- ExifTool is developed by Phil Harvey. 
- It is a platform-independent Perl library coupled with a full-featured command-line implementation for reading, writing and manipulating the metadata across a broad range of files, particularly the JPEG images. 
- This metadata may comprise a bunch of information such as the camera make, file type, permissions, file size etc., though it further offers more details about the photograph, like the exposure, the shutter speed and whether the flash fired or not. 
- ExifTool probably gives us the simplest way to extract metadata from files, as it is free and an open-source program.


## Installation ##

- Exiftool is quite easy to deploy. It’s just about hitting our Linux terminal and cloning the tool from GitHub.


```bash
git clone https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool.git 
```

In addition, we need to install the necessary package for it.

```bash
sudo apt-get install libimage-exiftool-perl
```

- So, we’ve mounted the tool in our system. Let’s take a closer look at it.

## Usage of Exiftool ##

- To extract the entire metadata of a file, we just need to execute the given below command:

```bash
exiftool  <filename>
```

- From the below image, you can now notice that we’ve got all the information drawn from our image file from the very basic to advance.

- However, if we need to capture the ids along with exif tags in the Hexa-Decimal format, though we need to run the following command:

```bash
exiftool -H <filename>
```

- From the below image, we can see that there is a lot of information stored within these Exif tags.

- Extract the Common Meta-Data Information

- Now execute the given below command which will provide us with the output of the most common Exif tags of the image file.

```
exiftool  –common <filename.jpg>
```
