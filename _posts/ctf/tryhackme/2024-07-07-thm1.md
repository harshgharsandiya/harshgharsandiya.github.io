# Math Equations in Chirpy

Here is a block math example:

$$
E = mc^2
$$

Here is an equation with numbering:

$$
\begin{equation}
  E = mc^2
  \label{eq:energy}
\end{equation}
$$

This is inline math: "The famous equation is $$ E = mc^2 $$."

You can also use math in lists:
1. \$$ E = mc^2 $$
2. \$$ F = ma $$
