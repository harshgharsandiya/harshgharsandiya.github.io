# Blockchain

- It is a **`distributed ledger`** with growing lists of records (blocks) that are **securely linked together** via **cryptographic hashes**.
- Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data
- Blockchain ensures **synchronization** of information within a finite time interval.
- It is a **decentralized** database that enables multiple nodes to **communicate without a central authority**.
- Each node maintains a **local copy** of the global ledger, ensuring consistency and preventing reliance on a single entity.
- Data on the blockchain is **tamper-proof, verifiable, and persistent**.
- It acts as a **public ledger**, storing historical information for future computation.
- **Example**: In banking, historical transactions are stored and used to validate new transactions.

## Properties of Blockchain

1. **Decentralization** – No single entity has control over the network.
2. **Distributed Ledger** – Data is replicated across multiple nodes for reliability.
3. **Consensus Mechanism** – Ensures all participants agree on the validity of transactions.
4. **Security & Immutability** – Cryptographic techniques prevent data tampering.
5. **Transparency & Auditability** – Transactions are publicly recorded and verifiable.
6. **Disintermediation** – Eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries.
7. **Irrefutability** – Digitally signed transactions cannot be denied or reversed.
8. **Permanence** – Once recorded, transactions cannot be modified or deleted.
9. **Network Resilience** – Redundancy across nodes ensures system robustness.
10. **Fault Tolerance** – Can maintain security even with a fraction of malicious participants.
11. **Guaranteed Transaction Inclusion** – Valid transactions are always processed.
12. **Censorship Resistance** – No entity can restrict participation in the network.
13. **High Availability** – Continuous operation without downtime.
14. **Robust Security** – Advanced cryptographic protocols safeguard data integrity.

## Limitations of Blockchain

1. **Scalability** – Slow transaction processing and high resource usage.
2. **Adoption** – Requires broader industry acceptance.
3. **Regulation** – Unclear legal frameworks.
4. **Immaturity** – Still developing with technical challenges.
5. **Privacy** – Transparency may conflict with confidentiality.

## Architecture of Generic Blockchain

# Generic Elements of a Blockchain

- Block is composed of
    1. **Transactions** (Block Body) : Record of an event.
    2. **Hash of Previous block**
    3. **Time stamp :** Creation time of block
    4. **Nonce** : Use only once number provide replay protection, authentication and encryption
    5. **Merkle root** :  hash of all the nodes of a Merkle
    tree.
- **Genesis Block**: The **first block** in a blockchain, hardcoded at the start.

# Hash Functions

- Maps data of arbitrary length to a fixed-size output.
- Trivial hash function → H(x) = x mod n
- Fixed-size hash also known as digest/checksum
- Ensures **data integrity**.
- Examples:
    - **SHA family**: SHA1 (SHA160), SHA256, SHA512
    - **RIPEMD family**: RIPEMD160, RIPEMD256
- Security level (e.g., SHA160 needs 2^160 steps to break; reduced to 2^80 by the birthday paradox).

## Requirements for Secure Hash Functions

1. **Preimage Resistance (One-wayness)**
- Given *x*, we can compute *H(x)*, but from *H(x)*, we cannot determine *x*.
1. **Second Preimage Resistance (Weak Collision Resistance)**
- Given *x1* and *H(x1)*, finding *x2* such that *H(x1) == H(x2)* is difficult.
1. **Collision Resistance (Strong Collision Resistance)**
- Finding two different inputs (*x1 ≠ x2*) that produce the same hash is computationally hard.
1. **Avalanche Effect**
- A small change in input leads to a significant change in hash output.

# Merkle Tree

- **Structure**:
    - **Leaf nodes** → Contain hashes of data blocks.
    - **Non-leaf nodes** → Contain hashes of their child nodes.
- **Functionality**:
    - Used to secure multiple documents (e.g., D1, D2, D3, D4).
    - Any change in a document alters the **root hash**, ensuring integrity.
- **Applications**:
    - **Data integrity in Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Networks** → Ensures received data blocks are unaltered.
    - **Bitcoin implementation** → Ensures shared transaction data remains unmodified and trustworthy.

# Sidechain

- Sidechains are smaller blockchains that run parallel to the mainchain, enhancing functionality and efficiency.
- Sidechains rely on the mainchain, but the mainchain operates independently.
- Allow transfer of token movement between the mainchain and sidechain.
- Token from  one blockchain can be used in the
sidechain and vice versa called **`pegged sidechain`** because supports two-way pegged assets.
- Coins are burned as proof of stake, validating transactions. (Proof of Burn)

# Cryptography

## CIAAN Model

1. **Confidentiality** – Ensures data is accessible only to authorized users.
2. **Integrity** – Guarantees data remains unaltered and trustworthy.
3. **Availability** – Ensures data and systems are accessible when needed.
4. **Authentication** – Verifies the identity of users and devices.
5. **Non-repudiation** – Prevents denial of actions or transactions by involved parties.

## Types

# Symmetric

- Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption.
- Share Key / Secret Key
- Faster than asymmetric but require secure key exchange.

## Types of Symmetric

1. **Stream Ciphers** – Encrypt data bit-by-bit.
2. **Block Ciphers** – Encrypt data in fixed-size blocks.

### Stream Ciphers

- Process data one bit at a time.
- **Types**:
    1. **Synchronous Stream Ciphers** – Keystream depends only on the key.
    2. **Asynchronous Stream Ciphers** – Keystream depends on key + encrypted data.
- Security depends on randomness of the keystream.
- Examples: **RC4, A5**

### Block Ciphers

- Encrypts fixed-length blocks of data.
- Uses substitution-permutation networks (SPN) and Feistel structures.
- **Key Concepts**:
    1. **Confusion (Substitution)** – Make relationship between plaintext and ciphertext complex (via S-boxes). 
    2. **Diffusion (Transposition)** – Spreads plaintext statistically over ciphertext.
- **Modes of Operation**:
    1. **ECB (Electronic Code Book)** 
    2. **CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)** 
    3. **OFB (Output Feedback)** 
    4. **CTR (Counter Mode)** 
- **Examples**: **DES, AES**

# Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

- **Block Size :** 128 bits

| **(Number of Rounds)** | **Key Size (in bits)** |
|-------------------------|------------------------|
| 10                      | 128                    |
| 12                      | 192                    |
| 14                      | 256                    |

- Used in **blockchain** to sign and verify transactions.
- Ensures **authentication** and **non-repudiation**.
- Common algorithms: **RSA, DSA, ECDSA**.

---

# RSA Key Generation

1. **Modulus Generation:**
    - Pick two large **prime numbers** p and q.
    - Compute **modulus**
    
    $$ n = p×q $$
    
- **Choose a Co-Prime e:**
    - Pick e such that
    
    $$
    1 < e < (p-1)(q-1)
    $$
    
    - e must be **co-prime** to (p−1)(q−1) (i.e., no common factors except 1).
- **Public Key:**
    - (n,e) is the **public key** (can be shared).
    - Keep p and q **secret**.
- **Private Key Calculation:**
    - Compute **private key** d using:
    
    $$
    d = e^{-1} \mod (p-1)(q-1)
    
    $$
    
    - This means
        
        $$
        (e×d)mod(p−1)(q−1)=1.
        $$
        
- **Encryption & Decryption:**
    - **Encryption:**
    
    $$
    C = P^e mod\ n
    $$
    
    - **Decryption:**
        
        $$
        P = C^d mod\ n
        $$
        

## RSA Digital Signature Algorithm

---

# Elliptic Curve Cryptography

- Uses the equations:
    
    $$
    y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
    $$
    
- **More secure with smaller keys** (e.g., 256-bit ECC ≈ 3072-bit RSA).
- Used in **ECDH** (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) for key exchange.
- Used in **ECDSA** (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for digital signatures.
- **Operations:**
    1. **Point Addition**: Adds two different points.
    2. **Point Doubling**: Adds a point to itself.

## ECDSA

- **Private Key (sk)**: A randomly generated integer used for signing.
- **Public Key (pk):**

$$
pk  = sk \ * \ G
$$

where G is the generator point on elliptic curve.

- Signature (r, s):  Two integers generated during the signing process.

### Signing

$$
r = k  \ * \ G
$$

$$
s = k^{-1}(H(M) \ + \ r.sk
$$

### Verification

$$
c = s^{-1} (mod \ N)
$$

$$
u1 = H(M) \ c \ (mod \ N)
$$

$$
u2 = r.c \ (mod \ N)
$$

$$
P = u1.G \ + \ u2.pk
$$

$$
Prove \  r == P (mod N)
$$
